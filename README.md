A very simple http server implemented with nodejs. To run it, follow these steps:


1. Download and install node: https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/

	Instalation will tipically be done at /usr/local/ (check it yourserf), and make sure that /usr/loca/bin/ is in your $PATH beacause it is there you will find node and npm

2. Download this project to an arbitrary folder (e.g. git pull)

	You do not need to execute 'npm init' to generate the package.json file beacause i have already done.

3.  Optional: edit app.js file to set it to use a different hostname and port

4. Run the command 'node app' from terminal and open in a browser the url http://localhost:3000/ to see the result
